### Hey there, I'm Brendan ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ“š I'm in my third year student at UBC studying integrated engineering with a focus on computer engineering and applied maths.

Currently I am working on my capstone project, Overlap which you can find [here](https://github.com/IGEN330-Overlap/Overlap). 

âš¡ Fun fact: I love hockey and soccer and am particularly intersted in advanced sports analytics.

To learn more about me you can also find me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brendan-lai-176460182).
