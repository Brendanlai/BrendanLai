### Hey there, I'm Brendan ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ“š I'm in my final year at UBC studying integrated engineering with a focus on computer engineering and applied maths.

My current capstone project is foosbot an autonomous foosball opponent which you can find the code for [here]([https://github.com/foosbot-igen430/foosbot-computer/]).

âš¡ Fun fact: I love hockey and soccer and particularly, fantasy leagues using advanced stats to build a winning team.

To learn more about me you can also find me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brendan-lai-176460182).
