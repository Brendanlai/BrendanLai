### Hey there, I'm Brendan ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ“š I'm recently graduated from UBC integrated engineering with a focus on computer engineering and applied maths.

Currently I'm working part-time at BC Children's Hospital developing dashboards and supporting the Pediatric Anesthesiology Resarch Team (PART) in their research initiatives.
My final capstone project was foosbot an autonomous foosball opponent which you can find more info on [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FNWNzub9BFkjC3ssFo5zJb3rbLoISCuC).

âš¡ Fun fact: I love hockey and soccer and particularly, fantasy leagues using advanced stats to build a winning team.
